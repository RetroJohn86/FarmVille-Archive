NOTE : For the database name, I suggest ( farmvilledb ), For username ( root ) and Password ( test )

Now initialize the server by clicking the elephant, then click again to shut it off. Now change the root password to the one you set earlier ( test ). toggle the server on and copy the assets folder into ( fv/public/farmville ). Now open the Laragon terminal, and type ( cd fv ) click enter, then run these commands and wait until it complete ( composer update ), ( php artisan key:generate ), ( php artisan migrate ), ( npm install -i ), ( npm run build ) and ( php artisan serve ). Now click the database button and create a session with a name of your choosing, input the username ( root ) and password ( test ), click save then open, deselect the yellow triangle warning icon beside the donate button to allow errors, select farmvilledb, and File->Run SQL File->farmvilledb.sql from supplements (errors are normal!)
